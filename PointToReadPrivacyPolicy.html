    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong>Feb. 21, 2025</p>
    
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>SnapReader</strong> ("we," "our," or "us") handles user privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how our app operates.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or share any personal data. Our app functions entirely on-device and does not transmit any data to external servers.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera Usage:</strong> Our app uses the device's camera solely for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to convert text into speech. The captured images and recognized text are processed locally and are not stored or shared.</li>
        <li><strong>Text Processing:</strong> The extracted text is used only for real-time speech output and is not saved on the device or transmitted elsewhere.</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> The app may store user-selected preferences (such as voice selection and reading speed) locally on the device. These preferences are not shared with any third party.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since our app does not collect or store user data, there is no risk of unauthorized access, misuse, or data breaches.</p>
    
    <h2>5. User Rights</h2>
    <p>As our app does not collect or store any personal data, no action is required to request access, modification, or deletion of personal information.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app or on our official website.</p>
